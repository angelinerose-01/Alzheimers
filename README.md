This project  aims to Provide a simple tool to the patients to get an early indication of Alzheimer’s disease.Patients can take the necessary tests on their homes and get a pre consultation or a pre diagnosis almost immediately. 
This tool helps subjects predict if they have Alzheimer's or not in comfort of their houses. The model is trained taking into consideration the different methods and combinations of data that is available for processing. The data is fitted to the Random Forest algorithm and the model is trained. When a patient detail is entered, the model would predict if the patient has Alzheimer’s disease or not .
Based on th tool’s prediction the patient  can get an early advice to consult the doctors.
## Data
The model was trained based on different cognitive test scores which was obtained from the OASIS website .
